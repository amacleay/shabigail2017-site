        <p>
          For those of you who are traveling from out-of-town, we are so grateful that you are making the trip to Wolfeboro for our wedding celebration.

        <p>
          <em>Please note</em> that Google Maps and GPS systems do not recognize the rural location with accuracy; the camp staff has found that many people have gotten lost using these methods. They recommend using GPS or Google Maps to get you to Wolfeboro, NH, and then following the below directions to the Camp.
        </p>

        <h2> To Camp from Wolfeboro:</h2>

        <p>
          In Wolfeboro, 28 N veers off to the right. Do not follow 28N, but at the Junction of 109, continue straight on the main road through the center of Wolfeboro. You should now be traveling on 109 N.
        </p>

        <p>
          Follow approximately 5.5 miles to camp.
        </p>

        <p>
          4 miles outside of Wolfeboro, you will pass the Libby Museum on your right (camp is exactly 2 miles from this building), and shortly thereafter you will pass Tuftonboro Neck Rd. on your left.
        </p>
        <p>
          Look for a green and white YMCA sign and Northwoods Road on the left.
        </p>

        <p>
          Turn left onto Northwoods Road and proceed past the farmhouse/ Leadership Center.
        </p>


        <h2> Traveling by Air:</h2>

        <p>
        For those flying, we recommend flying into Boston, MA (BOS), Manchester, NH (MHT), or Portland, ME (PWM).  See the next sections for how to get to the camp after landing.
        </p>

        <h2> Traveling by Car:</h2>

        <p>
        Use your GPS and drive there.  Travel time by car from these airports is roughly 2 hrs from BOS, 75 min from MHT, and 90 min from PWM.  We strongly recommend coordinating with others to get to the camp.
        </p>

        <h2> Traveling by Bus:</h2>

        <p>
        Shuttles can be booked between Boston and Manchester airports directly to the camp on Lakes Region Airport Shuttle.  Booking a one way shuttle between Boston and North Woods Camp is roughly $200 for 2 people and 2 bags or ~$250 for 6 people and 6 bags.  So, find some friends and save some green (money and earth)!
